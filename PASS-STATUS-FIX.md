# 🔧 Pass Status Display Fix

## Problem
Students were making payments and passes were being issued, but the admin dashboard was showing all passes as **"Not Issued"** with **"Pending"** status.

## Root Cause
When students paid, the system was:
- ✅ Creating payment records in `payments` collection
- ✅ Creating pass records in `passes` collection  
- ❌ **NOT updating** `paymentStatus` and `passStatus` fields in the `users` collection

The admin dashboard reads from the `users` collection, so it couldn't see the pass status.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Payment Flow Updated** ✅
Modified `src/pages/student/PaymentOptions.jsx` to properly update user status:

```javascript
// Now sets these fields when payment succeeds:
paymentStatus: "success",
passStatus: "Issued",
```

**Effect:** All NEW payments from now on will show correct status in admin dashboard.

### 2. **Added "Fix Statuses" Button** ✅
Added to Admin Dashboard (`ManageStudents.jsx`):
- New button: **"Fix Statuses"**
- Automatically updates all existing student records
- Shows how many students were updated

**How to use:**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Manage Students
2. Click the **"Fix Statuses"** button
3. Wait for confirmation message
4. All existing paid students will now show as "Issued"

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Updated App
```bash
cd bus-pass-system

```

### Step 2: Fix Existing Student Records
After deployment:
1. Login to Admin Dashboard
2. Go to **Manage Students** page
3. Click **"Fix Statuses"** button (top right)
4. Wait for success message

**Example output:**
