# 🚀 Deploy Bus Pass System to Firebase Hosting

## Quick Deploy Steps (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Login to Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```
This will open your browser - login with your Google account.

### Step 2: Initialize Hosting (if not already done)
```bash
firebase init hosting
```

**Select these options:**
- Use existing project: **bus-pass-system-a797e**
- Public directory: **build** (not dist!)
- Single-page app: **Yes**
- GitHub auto-deploy: **No** (for now)

### Step 3: Build Your App
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

### Step 4: Deploy!
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Step 5: Get Your URL!
You'll see:
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

**Problem: "firebase: command not found"**
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

**Problem: Build fails**
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Problem: Page not found after deploy**
- Make sure you selected "build" as public directory (not "dist")
- Make sure you said "Yes" to single-page app rewrite

## 📊 Monitor Your App:

**Firebase Console:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bus-pass-system-a797e

**Hosting Dashboard:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bus-pass-system-a797e/hosting

---

## 💡 Tips:

1. **Test locally first:** `npm start` before deploying
2. **Check build:** Look in `build` folder after running `npm run build`
3. **Custom domain:** Can add later in Firebase Console (Hosting > Add custom domain)
4. **Rollback:** Firebase keeps all versions, can rollback instantly

Good luck! 🚀
