# 💰 Fee Display Fix - Paid Amount Now Showing

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **Issue:**
- ✅ Status updating correctly (Success, Issued)
- ❌ Fee/Paid amount showing ₹0 in admin dashboard

### **Root Cause:**
The fee calculation was relying on `paymentHistory` state, which hadn't updated yet with the current payment. This caused timing issues.

---

## 🔧 **The Fix**

### **Before:**
```javascript
// Used paymentHistory (not yet updated)
const previousPaid = paymentHistory.filter(...).reduce(...)
const totalPaidAmount = previousPaid + amount;
```

### **After:**
```javascript
// Get existing fee directly from database
const existingFee = Number(profileData?.fee || 0);
const currentAmount = Number(amount);
const totalPaidAmount = existingFee + currentAmount;
```

## 💡 **How It Works Now**

### **Payment Flow:**
```
Student Pays ₹5000
        ↓
Get current fee from database (₹0 or existing)
        ↓
Add current payment: ₹0 + ₹5000 = ₹5000
        ↓
Update user profile:
  • fee: ₹5000
  • lastPaymentAmount: ₹5000
  • paymentStatus: "success"
  • passStatus: "Issued"
        ↓
Admin Dashboard Shows: ₹5000 ✅
```

### **Multiple Payments:**
```
First Payment: ₹5000
  Database fee: ₹0 + ₹5000 = ₹5000 ✅

Second Payment: ₹3000
  Database fee: ₹5000 + ₹3000 = ₹8000 ✅

Total Shows: ₹8000 ✅
```

## 🔍 **Debug Logging Added**

When payment succeeds, console will show:
```
🔄 Updating user profile with payment status...
