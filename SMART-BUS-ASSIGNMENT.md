### **Solution Now:**
- ✅ Students select bus & stage **ONCE** (first payment)
- ✅ System saves it automatically
- ✅ Future payments load instantly
- ✅ **NO admin work needed!**

### **Scalability:**

---

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **How Detection Works:**
```javascript
// Check if student already has bus/stage
if (profile.busId && profile.stageId) {
  // Student has saved route
  hasSavedBusStage = true;
  // Auto-load their route
  setSelectedBus(profile.busId);
  setSelectedStage(profile.stageId);
} else {
  // New student - show selection
  hasSavedBusStage = false;
}
```

### **Automatic Save:**
When payment succeeds, `PaymentOptions.jsx` saves:
```javascript
await setDoc(doc(db, "users", currentUser.uid), {
  busNumber: bus.number,
  busId: bus.id,
  stage: stage.name,
  stageId: stage.id,
  // ... other fields
}, { merge: true });
```

## 🔒 **Change Route**

### **If Student Needs to Change:**

4. Future payments use new route

**Why?**
- Prevents accidental changes
- Maintains data integrity
- Ensures accurate billing

Admin can see each student's assigned route:

```
| Student    | Bus | Stage  | Fee   | Status  |

| Mohammad   | 5   | Stage A| ₹5000 | Success |
| shaik      | 3   | Stage B| ₹3000 | Success |
