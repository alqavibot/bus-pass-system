## 2️⃣ **Fixing Pass Status Issues** (IMPORTANT!)

### When You See This Alert:
```
⚠️ Found 5 students with successful payments but status not showing
Click "Fix Now" to update their pass status in the table
                                            [Fix Now]
```

### What It Means:
- Some students paid successfully
- Their passes were issued
- But the table still shows "Pending" / "Not Issued"

### How to Fix:
**Option 1:** Click **"Fix Now"** button in the alert
**Option 2:** Click **"Fix Statuses"** button in toolbar

**What Happens:**
- System scans all payments

### After Fixing:
Table will show correct status:
```
| Student Name    | Payment Status | Pass Status |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Mohammad Abdul | Success ✅     | Issued ✅    |
| shaik pasha    | Success ✅     | Issued ✅    |
```

---

## 3️⃣ **Search Students**

### Search Works On:
- Student name
- Hall ticket number
- Email
- Branch
- Year

### Example Searches:
- Type **"shaik"** → Finds all students with "shaik" in name
- Type **"22C11"** → Finds hall tickets starting with 22C11
- Type **"CSE"** → Finds all CSE students
- Type **"4"** → Finds all 4th year students

---

## 4️⃣ **Understanding Status Colors**

### Payment Status:
- 🟢 **Success** = Student paid successfully
- 🟡 **Pending** = Payment not completed
- 🔴 **Failed** = Payment failed

### Pass Status:
- 🟢 **Issued** = Pass generated and active
- ⚪ **Not Issued** = Pass not generated yet

---

## 5️⃣ **Student Statistics**

Top of page shows:
```
[6 Total] [5 Paid] [5 Passes]
```

**Meaning:**
- **6 Total** = Total students (with current filters)
- **5 Paid** = Students with successful payment
- **5 Passes** = Passes issued

**If numbers don't match:**
- Paid = 5, but Passes = 0
- **Action:** Click "Fix Statuses" button!
